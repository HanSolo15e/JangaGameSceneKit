 A small project recreating janga in sceneKit.

 ## NOTE:
  * It might not work because some texture and game assets might not be in the repo for some reason.
  * performance can kinda be crap when the device is on low power mode or running on mac (probobly because of the High Res textures that need downscaling)
 

 ## To Do
   * Make better aperence for UI
   * improve bad performance
